// Type Shapes 
// Typescript knows what types our objects are it
// also knows what shapes our objects adhere to
// Objects shape describe what properties and methods 
// it does or doesn't contain 

// The built in types in Javascript each have known properties 
// and methods that always exist. All string String SVGAElement, for ex ,
// are known to have a .length() property and .toLowerCase() method.
